The Quantitative Methods Research Group (QMRG) is opening its annual prize for the best undergraduate dissertation that engages with quantitative methods and methodologies.

Students need not necessarily be aligned to a geography(-related) discipline, but their work should be engaged with geographical problems and phenomena from a quantitative perspective. Innovative geographic data science analyses, effective deployments of existing geographical science methods, or fundamental research in spatial models will all be considered. Entries are judged by members of the QMRG committee who may, depending on the number and types of entries received, decide to award a single overall prize or multiple separate prizes for different fields of the discipline.


There is a cash award for the winner(s). 

**Deadline**: 12th July 2024 @ 5:00 pm (GMT)

**To submit**: Please email a copy of the dissertation without any indication of the awarded mark to: Dr Yijing Li [qmrgdissertation@outlook.com](qmrgdissertation@outlook.com)


**Terms and Conditions**
• Entries are limited to submissions from UK higher education institutions.
• Each institution is limited to ONE entry per department.
• Please submit with the student’s agreement and by an appropriate member of staff (the Head of Department or appointed representative).
• Please provide an email address for the student that will be live after September 2024.
